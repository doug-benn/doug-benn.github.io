This blog is powered by Github pages, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme.

The purpose of the blog is for me to learn and maintain skills likes git sources control and github actions. It is also for me to document different code snippets I have made use of or I think are useful, they might not be the most efficient way of doing things and if I have made a mistake please let me know. I hope you find this blog interesting or useful.
