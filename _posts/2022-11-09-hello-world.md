# "Hello, World!"

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

"Hello, World!" seems like a good first post. It is usually the first thing one writes and runs when using a new language or a fresh installer/version.

But this time I am "Hello, World!"ing my "Blog"/"Portfolio". The plan is to start creating a record of anything that I find useful from code snippets to excel formulas. It will also serve as a portfolio of my work and help me practice skills I would like to gain, improve and maintain. Namely git, github pages and github actions in relation to this blog.
